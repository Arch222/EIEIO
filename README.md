Earth Points App for Georgia Tech Grand Challenges Cohort of 2021. 
This app is a minimum viable product for the Grand Challenges Cohort of 2021. It seeks to provide users with a routing system, time and money efficiency with regards to transporation, and environmental data. It also has a map for public transportation tracking purposes. I will work on this project periodically.
